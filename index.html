		In this work, we implement a fully convolutional segmenter featuring both a learned group structure and a regularized weight-pruner to reduce the high computational cost in volumetric image segmentation. We validated our framework on the ACDC dataset featuring one healthy and four pathology groups imaged throughout the cardiac cycle. Our technique achieved Dice scores of 96.80% (LV blood-pool), 93.33% (RV blood-pool) and 90.0% (LV Myocardium) with five-fold cross-validation and yielded similar clinical parameters as those estimated from the ground truth segmentation data. Based on these results, this technique has the potential to become an efficient and competitive cardiac image segmentation tool that may be used for cardiac computer-aided diagnosis, planning and guidance applications.

        With the advent of Cardiac Cine Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Imaging, there has been a paradigm shift in medical technology, thanks to its capability of imaging different structures within the heart without ionizing radiation. However, it is very challenging to conduct pre-operative planning of minimally invasive cardiac procedures without accurate segmentation and identification of the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV) blood-pool, and LV-myocardium. Manual segmentation of those structures, nevertheless, is time-consuming and often prone to error and biased outcomes. Hence, automatic and computationally efficient segmentation techniques are paramount. In this work, we propose a novel memory-efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture as a modification of both CondenseNet, as well as DenseNet for ventricular blood-pool segmentation by introducing a bottleneck block and an upsampling path. Our experiments show that the proposed architecture runs on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset using half (50%) the memory requirement of DenseNet and one-twelfth (∼ 8%) of the memory requirements of U-Net, while still maintaining excellent accuracy of cardiac segmentation. We validated the framework on the ACDC dataset featuring one healthy and four pathology groups whose heart images were acquired throughout the cardiac cycle and achieved the mean dice scores of 96.78% (LV blood-pool), 93.46% (RV blood-pool) and 90.1% (LVMyocardium). These results are promising and promote the proposed methods as a competitive tool for cardiac image segmentation and clinical parameter estimation that has the potential to provide fast and accurate results, as needed for pre-procedural planning and / or pre-operative applications.

         Estimating and visualizing myocardial active stress wave patterns is crucial to understanding the mechanical activity of the heart and provides a potential non-invasive method to assess myocardial function. These patterns can be reconstructed by analyzing 2D and/or 3D tissue displacement data acquired using medical imaging. Here we describe an application that utilizes a 3D finite element formulation to reconstruct active stress from displacement data. As a proof of concept, a simple cubic mesh was used to represent a myocardial tissue “sample” consisting of a 10 x 10 x 10 lattice of nodes featuring different fiber directions that rotate with depth, mimicking cardiac transverse isotropy. In the forward model, tissue deformation was generated using a test wave with active stresses that mimic the myocardial contractile forces. The generated deformation field was used as input to an inverse model designed to reconstruct the original active stress distribution. We numerically simulated malfunctioning tissue regions (experiencing limited contractility and hence active stress) within the healthy tissue. We also assessed model sensitivity by adding noise to the deformation field generated using the forward model. The difference image between the original and reconstructed active stress distribution suggests that the model accurately estimates active stress from tissue deformation data with a high signal-to-noise ratio.

         With the advent of robot-assisted surgery, there has been a paradigm shift in medical technology for minimally invasive surgery. However, it is very challenging to track the position of the surgical instruments in a surgical scene, and accurate detection & identification of surgical tools is paramount. Deep learning-based semantic segmentation in frames of surgery videos has the potential to facilitate this task. In this work, we modify the U-Net architecture by introducing a pre-trained encoder and re-design the decoder part, by replacing the transposed convolution operation with an upsampling operation based on nearest-neighbor (NN) interpolation. To further improve performance, we also employ a very fast and flexible data augmentation technique. We trained the framework on 8 x 225 frame sequences of robotic surgical videos available through the MICCAI 2017 EndoVis Challenge dataset and tested it on 8 x 75 frame and 2 x 300 frame videos. Using our U-NetPlus architecture, we report a 90.20\% DICE for binary segmentation, 76.26% DICE for instrument part segmentation, and 46.07% for instrument type (i.e., all instruments) segmentation, outperforming the results of previous techniques implemented and tested on these data.

         Brain tumor detection through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a very challenging task even in today's modern medical image processing research. Expert Neuro-radiologists diagnose even glioblastoma types deadly brain cancer using manual segmentation which is tedious and even not accurate that much. Deep learning models like U-net deep convolution neural networks have been widely used in biomedical image segmentation. Though this model works better on BRATS 2015 dataset by using pixel-wise segmentation map of the input image like an auto-encoder which assures best segmentation accuracy, but it is not correct for all the cases. So, I have planned to improve this U-net model by replacing the de-convolution part with the upsampled by Nearest-neighbor algorithm and also by using elastic transformation for increasing the training dataset to make the model more robust on Low graded tumor. I had trained my NNRET U-net model on BRATS 2017 dataset and got a better performance than the state of the art classic U-net model.
